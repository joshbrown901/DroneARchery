# DroneARchery
We propose a novel concept of augmented reality (AR) human-drone interaction driven by RL-based method to achieve intuitive single drone control. 
The DroneArchery system developed by us allows the user to quickly deploy a drone, generating flight paths simulating archery. The haptic interface LinkGlide delivers a tactile stimulus of the bowstring tension to the forearm to increase the precision of aiming. The drone dynamically avoids collisions between each other, the drone following the user, and external obstacles with behavior control based on deep reinforcement learning. The developed concept was tested in the scenario with a human, where the user shoots from a virtual bow with a real drone to hit the target. The human operator observes the ballistic trajectory of the drone in an AR and achieves a realistic and highly recognizable experience of the bowstring tension through the haptic display.
